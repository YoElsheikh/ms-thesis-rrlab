# ms-thesis-rrlab
My master thesis carried out at the Robotics Research Lab at RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau titled: Reinforcement Learning on Sensor Data and Reaction Grid Maps.
I will be adding the code gradually. Due proprietary reasons, .cpp and .h files that are related to finroc are not included. If this code should be needed, please contact me, I will have to consult the AG Robotersysteme.
